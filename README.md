# Comparison_interaction_methodologies
Here we have code and data that will be used to compare 3 different methodologies used to infer interaction frequencies between plants and pollinators: transect observations, gut DNA contents, and pollen ball DNA contents.

# Data

# Scripts
Data are primarily processed in scripts according to their origin (e.g. Interaction_Data.R, metabarcoding_data.R), and then recalled in other scripts intended for primary analysis (e.g. interactions_x_metabarcoding.R) or side analyses and cleaning (e.g. sed_db_genera_check.R).
